<p>One of the things I have been thinking about while starting to work on
<a href="https://github.com/mosscomp/moss"><code>moss</code></a> again is whether I should implement
one of the many <a href="https://riscv.org">RISC-V</a> flavors, or whether I should design
an entirely new instruction set architecture (ISA). Designing a new one might
seem like the ultimate bike-shedding effort, and if my immediate goal was
getting something useful into production, I almost certainly would not embark on
the journey. However, there are a few reasons why designing a new ISA is
compelling to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>It forces me to think about the pros and cons of existing ISAs and decide
which design choices I want to emulate vs. eliminate.</li>
<li>It will undoubtedly result in discussion and iteration, which will in turn
result in artifacts that can be used as educational resources.</li>
<li>There are <em>potential</em> opportunities for optimization.</li>
</ul>
<p>These reasons could essentially be boiled down to a desire to understand what it
takes to design an ISA from scratch. While there are many, the most obvious
reason for <em>not</em> designing a new ISA is leveraging an existing software
ecosystem. Updating compiler toolchains, debuggers, and emulators to support a
new ISA is a monumental effort that typically takes many people a number of
years.</p>
<p>Perhaps the real decision that I am making is whether I want to support existing
software ecosystems. <code>moss</code> is characterized as a vertically-integrated
computer, and an extreme interpretation could be that you have to use the <code>moss</code>
stack to work with the <code>moss</code> computer. One could even argue that a stable ISA
isn’t needed at all in this world; there would only be an internal intermediate
representation used by the toolchain that turned whatever a high-level <code>moss</code>
program looked like into machine instructions that were executed on the <code>moss</code>
processor.</p>
<p>That being said, there is nothing stopping me from building out a fully
integrated end-to-end <code>moss</code> stack, even if other toolchains could also be used
to target the hardware. In other words, there is no reason to break basic
interoperability if we don’t gain anything from doing so.</p>

  RISC-V Non-Standard Extensions

    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>The foundational core of any instruction set looks mostly the same: arithmetic
operations, control flow, and memory access. The simplest RISC-V implementation
is one that only supports the base Integer (<code>I</code>) extension (i.e. <code>RV32I</code>,
<code>RV64I</code>, <code>RV128I</code>). On top of that base, there are a number of <strong>standard</strong>
extensions, such as Multiplication and Division (<code>M</code>), Atomics (<code>A</code>),
Single-Precision Floating Point (<code>F</code>), and more. These extensions can be
combined to define new
<a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-profiles/blob/main/profiles.adoc">profiles</a>.</p>
<p>However, RISC-V also supports <strong>non-standard</strong> extensions, and though there are
some parameters for implementation, they mostly allow for arbitrary new
functionality to be implemented. From the <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/blob/main/src/extending.adoc">unprivileged RISC-V
specification</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A non-standard extension may be highly specialized and may conflict with other
standard or non-standard extensions. We anticipate a wide variety of
non-standard extensions will be developed over time, with some eventually
being promoted to standard extensions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This optionality frequently comes up as a critique of RISC-V as it could lead to
a complex fragmented ecosystem. However, for the purposes of <code>moss</code>, it allows
me to choose to use RISC-V as the foundation for the processor without
restricting any further experimentation or customization that may be desired in
the future.</p>
<p>In fact, most of the compelling reasons for designing a new ISA could similarly
be achieved by designing a non-standard RISC-V extension, all while going
through a process that would translate more directly to work outside of the
<code>moss</code> ecosystem.</p>

</h3>
<p>A nice side-effect of adopting RISC-V is that it makes immediate next steps more
clear: implementing an <code>RV64I</code> core. Let’s get to it!</p>
