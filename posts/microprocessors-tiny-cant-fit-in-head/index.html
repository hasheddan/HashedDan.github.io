        <p>I have not been able to make as much progress on
<a href="https://github.com/mosscomp/moss"><code>moss</code></a> over the last 14 days or so as I
would like, in large part because of limited time due to getting some exciting
work across the finish line at <a href="https://golioth.io/"><code>$dayjob</code></a>. However,
whenever I find myself limited in the amount of “hands on keyboard” time I have
to spend on a project, I try to invest more of my idle brain time (IBT, if you
will) thinking about the next stages of development, as well as higher level
long-term goals. The question that was floating around during my IBT this week
was <strong>whether it is possible for the design of a competitive modern
microprocessor to fit in one person’s head</strong>.</p>
<p>This question is really applicable to any system of sufficient complexity, but
it just so happens that the processors we use today are some of the most complex
systems in the proverbial “stack” of modern computing. If you talk to many
folks, they’ll explain that this complexity is
<em><a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks-NoSilverBullet.pdf">essential</a></em> — that is,
the end result would be diminished if any of the complexity was reduced. I trust
this assessment from folks with vastly more experience in this realm than my
current day self, but as with most things, I still want to verify.</p>
<p>For much of the complexity in modern microprocessors, there are clear
performance advantages. Techniques such as cache hierarchies, instruction
pipelining (<em>superpiplining</em>), and multiple issuance (<em>superscalar</em>), all of
which add more complexity in terms of both the number of transistors and the
logical model of operation, can lead to significant improvements. However, the
benefit of some instruction scheduling techniques are more ambiguous. Two
commonly used approaches are <strong>out-of-order execution (OoO)</strong> and <strong>speculative
execution</strong>. The former refers to the ability for a processor to “rearrange”
instructions in order to saturate pipelines and avoid costly cache misses. The
latter refers to the ability of a processor to “guess” the outcome of a branch
and speculatively execute the instructions that would follow if the guess was in
fact correct. There is a great description of both, and many other
microprocessor concepts, in the <a href="https://www.lighterra.com/papers/modernmicroprocessors/#instructionschedulingregisterrenamingandooo">Lighterra 90-Minute Modern Microprocessor
Guide</a>.</p>
<p>In most modern processors, these techniques are employed in tandem, providing
maximum freedom to exploit available resources. For example, instructions from a
speculatively executed branch may be rearranged such that they are intermingled
with those prior to the branch, potentially unlocking superior scheduling
opportunities. However, because the implementation of these features comes with
a complexity cost, it is worth evaluating whether the unlocked performance could
be achieved via less expensive means.</p>
<p>The alternatives to these techniques generally rely on static optimization
performed by the compiler. In my recent research, I read <a href="https://zilles.cs.illinois.edu/papers/mcfarlin_asplos_2013.pdf">Discerning the
Dominant Out-of-Order Performance Advantage: Is it Speculation or
Dynamism?</a>
(McFarlin, Tucker, Zilles), which gives an excellent breakdown of the sources of
performance advantages offered by OoO processors over static scheduling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We perceive, however, that there are two potential sources for the performance
advantage between the hardware OOO schedules and compiler-generated schedules
as executed by in-order machines:</p>
<ol>
<li>the OOO has few constraints other than true dependencies and functional
unit availability to constrain schedule generation, whereas existing ISAs
prevent the expression of some speculative schedules by compilers.</li>
<li>OOO can execute the same instructions in different schedules at different
points of the execution, reacting to the specific events observed during
each execution. We’ll call this advantage <strong>dynamism</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><em>- McFarlin, Tucker, Zilles (2013)</em></p>
<p>The big idea of the paper is that if the majority of the performance advantages
offered by out-of-order processors can be attributed to <em>speculation</em> (1) rather
than <em>dynamism</em> (2), then it is possible that an in-order processor could
achieve comparable performance if its ISA was able to fully express the same
speculation primitives to the compiler. This is a logical train of thought as it
isolates the capability (dynamism) of out-of-order machines that is
fundamentally not available to static optimization techniques.</p>
<p>Without diving too deeply into the methodology employed in the paper (you should
go read it!), the authors essentially simulate the behavior of an out-of-order
processor, extract the schedules it generates, then see if those same schedules
could be accomplished at compile time. While the results are nuanced, the
conclusion is that much of the benefits offered by out-of-order scheduling could
be achieved by relatively less expensive alternatives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The performance of our simulated machine with these harvested schedules
suggests that the dynamic flexibility of a full-blown OOO processor is
(expensive) over-kill and shows us some of the architectural features a more
statically-scheduled processor needs to achieve similar performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>- McFarlin, Tucker, Zilles (2013)</em></p>
<p>The conclusion is interesting on its own, but it is also worth noting the year
in which the paper was published. Since 2013, we have seen a slew of
microarchitectural attacks based on transient execution. The <a href="https://meltdownattack.com/">Meltdown and
Spectre</a> vulnerabilities revealed in 2017
illustrated how the complexity of modern day microprocessors, namely speculative
and out-of-order execution capabilities, open the door to leaking sensitive data
between processes. In the following years, many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_execution_CPU_vulnerability#Vulnerabilities_and_mitigations_summary">more vulnerabilities have been
disclosed</a>,
with the mitigations ranging from compiler updates to microcode patches. In some
cases, these mitigations have caused <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/01/02/intel_cpu_design_flaw/">significant performance
degradation</a>, and
in others, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/4/17198322/intel-spectre-patch-update-fix">full mitigation has not been
possible</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, I don’t think that the analysis by McFarlin, Tucker, and Zilles, or
the impacts of the vulnerabilities disclosed over the past few years, provide
conclusive evidence that dropping out-of-order or speculative execution
capabilities would be better for the industry. However, it does lead me to
question whether some of the microprocessor complexity we have deemed essential
in the name of ever improving performance may actually be <em>accidental</em>. I fully
acknowledge my bias here: as someone who is <a href="https://danielmangum.com/posts/a-three-year-bet-on-chip-design/">attempting to design a competitive
processor on my
own</a>, I <em>want</em>
it to be the case that simpler implementations may actually out perform more
complex ones when all facets are considered.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most likely answer is that there is enough essential complexity that
a competitive modern microprocessor design cannot fit in one person’s head, but
it is still true that the microprocessors we have today are much more complex
than they need to be. If so, I hope efforts such as mine play a small part is
leading us closer to systems that are more simple, more secure, and when it is
all said and done, more performant.</p>
<p>If you have experience in this space and want to weigh in, I would love to hear
from you!</p>
