<p>As I work on <a href="https://github.com/mosscomp/moss"><code>moss</code></a> and research modern
processor design patterns and techniques, I am also looking for patterns and
techniques from the past that, for one reason or another, have not persisted
into our modern machines. While on a run this week, I was listening to an old
<a href="https://oxide.computer/podcasts/oxide-and-friends/838550">Oxide and Friends
episode</a> where Bryan,
Adam, and crew were reminiscing on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARC">SPARC</a> instruction set architecture (ISA).
SPARC is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture originally
developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a>,
with the first machine, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation_1">SPARCstation1</a> (a.k.a. Sun 4/60,
a.k.a Campus), being delivered in 1987. It was heavily influenced by the early
RISC designs from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Patterson_(computer_scientist)">David
Patterson</a>
and team at Berkeley in the 1970s and 1980s, which is the same lineage from
which <a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a> has evolved. Given the
<a href="https://danielmangum.com/posts/why-create-new-isa/">decision</a> to base <code>moss</code> on
the RISC-V <code>RV64I</code> ISA, I was interested to learn more about the history and
finer details of SPARC.</p>
<p>The episode discusses a number of interesting attributes of the architecture, as
well as <a href="https://www.filibeto.org/sun/lib/hardware/enterprise_4500/BP_Ecache_10-16-01.pdf">some issues in specific
implementations</a>,
but one in particular stuck out to me: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_window">register
windows</a>. As it turns out,
register windows were not an innovation of SPARC, but rather a feature inherited
from those early Berkeley RISC designs. In fact, the very first design, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/285930.285981">RISC
I</a>, describes register windows
as a prominent component of making the simplified processor design feasible for
legitimate computation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It would appear that such constraints would result in a machine with
substantially poorer code density or poorer performance or both. In spite of
these constraints, the resulting architecture competes favorably with other
state-of-the-art machines such as VAX 11/780. <strong>This is largely because of an
innovative new scheme of register organization we call overlapped register
windows.</strong>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have previously written about <a href="https://danielmangum.com/posts/risc-v-bytes-caller-callee-registers/">how RISC-V uses
registers</a>,
as well as <a href="https://danielmangum.com/posts/risc-v-bytes-passing-on-the-stack/">what happens when we run out of
registers</a>.
Additionally, we <a href="https://danielmangum.com/posts/single-cycle-rv64-register-file/">recently
explored</a> the
Verilog implementation of the <code>moss</code> register file. As a brief recap, registers
are the fastest memory available to a processor, and thus the most desirable
location to store data. However, they are also typically the smallest memory,
with RISC-V supporting 32 general purpose registers (GPRs) in most
architectures; <code>RV32E</code> being the exception with 16 GPRs.</p>
<p>As detailed in the aforementioned posts, one important use of registers is
passing data from one procedure to another. To do so, there needs to be an
agreed upon convention for which registers the callee procedure (i.e. the one
being called) may manipulate and not restore, and which must be restored prior
to returning. Data in registers in the former category need to be persisted to a
secondary location, such as L1-L3 cache or RAM, so that they can be recovered
after control returns from the callee procedure. Registers in this group are
referred to as <strong>caller-saved</strong> while those that must be restored are referred
to as <strong>callee-saved</strong> Additionally, both the caller and callee procedures need
to know what registers are used for passing arguments, and which are used for
returning them. The <a href="https://danielmangum.com/posts/risc-v-bytes-caller-callee-registers/#defining-terms">table in this
post</a>
outlines which of the 32 GPRs in RISC-V are preserved across calls and which are
not.</p>

<p>One of the key insights in the development of the RISC architecture was the fact
that the performance of a processor could be improved by supporting a small set
of instructions that could be executed quickly and executing more of them. We
have <a href="https://danielmangum.com/posts/single-cycle-multicycle-processor-performance/">previously
discussed</a>
the CPU performance equation, which includes the number of instructions required
to define a program in the numerator (<strong>Instruction Count</strong>), meaning that, as
one would expect, driving up the instruction count means worse performance.
However, the RISC architecture is able to offset this increase with a larger
decrease in cycles per instruction (<strong>CPI</strong>), which is also a factor in the
numerator, thus driving the overall CPU time down.</p>
<p>Naturally, Patterson &amp; Sequin were interested in identifying which operations in
high-level languages (they evaluated C and Pascal) resulted in the largest
number of RISC instructions required. If common operations in high-level
languages reached a certain threshold in number of instructions required, the
offset in decreased CPI may not have been enough to improve overall performance.
Through their analysis, they identified the procedure call as the most
expensive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Using procedures involves two groups of time-consuming operations: saving or
restoring registers on each CALL or return, and passing parameters and results
to and from the procedure. Because our measurements on high-level language
programs indicate that local scalars are the most frequent operands, we wanted
to support the allocation of locals in registers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>- David A. Patterson and Carlo H. Sequin. 1998. RISC I: a reduced instruction
set VLSI computer. (Page 218)</em></p>
<p>With this being the case, they asked the logical question: how could we
eliminate some of this overhead? Interestingly, they were not the first to ask
this question. Their paper sites two contemporaries when introducing register
windows. The first is a lecture from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/forest-baskett-a5813413/">Forest
Baskett</a> in 1978, which
appears to have been lost to the sands of time. However, Baskett has had quite
the illustrious career, founding the Western Research Laboratory at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation">Digital
Equipment Corporation
(DEC)</a> and serving
as CTO at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Graphics">Silicon Graphics, Inc.
(SGI)</a>, two companies that have
been well chronicled in computing lore.</p>
<p>I feared the same fate for the second citation, but was able to find <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-sites-50a31a7b/details/experience/">Richard L.
Sites</a>’
paper <a href="https://caltechconf.library.caltech.edu/200/1/RichardLSites.pdf">How to Use 1,000
Registers</a>. Not
to be outdone, Sites also had quite the career as a professor at UC San Diego
and engineer at DEC, Adobe, and Google. In his paper, he makes an astute
observation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As short-term register memories get larger, subroutine calls will get slower,
unless we find better solutions to the stale data and alias problems.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>- Richard L. Sites. 1979. How to Use 1,000 Registers. (Page 529)</em></p>
<p>Put simply, if there are more registers accessible to and used by a given
procedure, there is more work to do when saving and restoring them on a given
procedure call. A solution is proposed in Section 5, <em>Techniques for Effective
Use of Large Short-Term Memories</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Assuming that almost all registers are in use at the point of call, and
almost all will be used by the subroutine (so that we cannot avoid come sort
of save/restore), then one way to speed up the call linkage is to have
duplicate register sets. Say there are four sets, 0-3, and that the calling
subroutine is using set 1. Then the called routine just starts using set 2,
and no data movement of set 1 to main memory is needed. This makes the
subroutine call quite fast, and it also makes the linkage overhead no longer
proportional to the number of resisters. When the subroutine returns, the
machine just switches back from set 2 to set 1.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>- Richard L. Sites. 1979. How to Use 1,000 Registers. (Page 530)</em></p>
<p>There are some issues that need to be addressed with the proposed functionality,
which Sites outlines in the paragraphs that follow. For example, what happens
when the number of nested subroutines exceeds the number of register sets? Sites
proposed a system that allowed for registers from parent procedures to be
&ldquo;dribbled back&rdquo; into main memory on unused memory access cycles in the
subroutines.</p>
<p>This cache of register sets, as Sites referred to them, were the precursor to
Patterson &amp; Sequin’s register windows, which build on this work while
introducing a few variations. One such variation is born out of the previously
described requirement for procedures to pass data between one another. Ideally,
that data would be passed in the fastest memory: registers. However, if each
procedure sees a different window, that is no longer feasible. To address the
issue, Patterson &amp; Sequin proposed that register windows <em>overlap</em>, meaning that
the high registers of the caller become the low registers of the callee. This
allows for the caller to pass parameters to the callee, and for the callee to
pass return values back to the caller.</p>

    alt="moss-sparc-reg-win-1"
  />
</div>
<p>In addition to the overlapping windows, a set of 10 global registers was set
aside and made accessible by all routines, as can bee seen in the diagram above.
Another variation was that rather than &ldquo;dribbling back&rdquo; registers to main
memory, Patterson &amp; Sequin proposed <strong>underflow</strong> and <strong>overflow</strong> semantics
that would cause traps to occur when the number of nested procedures exceeded
the number of register windows. A software-defined trap handler could then be
used to save and restore existing registers on a dedicated stack.</p>
<p>The last variation came in the form of how pointers were handled. Once again
trying to avoid having to place data unnecessarily into main memory, Patterson &amp;
Sequin reserved a portion of the memory address space to registers, such that
one procedure could access data in registers that were outside of its window.</p>

  SPARC Register Windows

</h2>
<p>Register windows are mentioned as the first attribute of the SPARC ISA in the
<a href="https://sparc.org/technical-documents/#V8">v8 architecture manual</a>. In fact,
the authors pay homage to the RISC I &amp; II designs explicitly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;SPARC, formulated at Sun Microsystems in 1985, is based on the RISC I &amp; II
designs engineered at the University of California at Berkeley from 1980
through 1982. the SPARC “register window” architecture, pioneered in UC
Berkeley designs, allows for straightforward, high-performance compilers and a
significant reduction in memory load/store instructions over other RISCs,
particularly for large application programs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>- The SPARC Architecture Manual, Version 8. 1990. (Page 4)</em></p>
<p>Even the diagram used in the registers section of the manual (Section 4) looks
quite similar to the one from the RISC I design.</p>



<div class="center-img">
  <img
    src="../../static/moss_sparc_reg_win_2.png"
    alt="moss-sparc-reg-win-2"
  />
</div>
<p>However, the good folks at Sun did put their own spin on register windows,
opting to expose more knobs to programmers that allowed for fine-grained control
over register window management.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;One difference between SPARC and the Berkeley RISC I &amp; II is that SPARC
provides greater flexibility to a compiler in its assignment of registers to
program variables. SPARC is more flexible because register window management
is not tied to procedure call and return (CALL and JMPL) instructions, as it
is on the Berkeley machines. Instead, separate instructions (SAVE and RESTORE)
provide register window management.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>- The SPARC Architecture Manual, Version 8. 1990. (Page 4)</em></p>
<p>This variation results in the ability to transfer control from one routine to
another <em>without</em> changing the register window. This enables a number of
windowing schemes, which are explored in greater detail in the appendix on
software considerations (Appendix D, Page 203).</p>

<p>To make the use of register windows more concrete, we can craft a minimal
example. The following program does not perform any computation of value, but
stepping through it illustrates how a given procedure sees its register window.</p>

<p>You may notice that the <code>nop</code> instruction in <code>main</code> executes after the call to
<code>sub1</code>. This is due to the fact that SPARC uses <strong>delayed control transfer</strong>.
We won’t dive into the rationale in this post, but it is also an architectural
pattern that isn’t present, or perhaps isn’t as obviously present, in modern
machines. We’ll explore more when I am working on pipelining in <code>moss</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All we have done thus far is load the value of <code>10</code> into the first output
register (<code>o1</code>), then jump to the first subroutine (<code>sub1</code>). Notably, jumping to
<code>sub1</code> did not change the value of <code>o1</code> as it is still seeing the same register
window. However, executing <code>save</code> illustrates a shift to the next window.</p>

caller procedure (<code>main</code>) has become the set of input registers for the callee
(<code>sub1</code>) — <code>o1</code> of <code>main</code> is <code>i1</code> of <code>sub1</code>. The subsequent call to <code>sub2</code>
illustrates that shifting register windows is not required, as it operates on
the same <code>o1</code> seen by <code>sub1</code>. We also use the <code>retl</code> (&ldquo;return from leaf
procedure&rdquo;) in <code>sub2</code>, which updates the <code>pc</code> to the address <code>o7+8</code>, rather than
<code>ret</code> (&ldquo;return from procedure&rdquo;), which updates the <code>pc</code> to the address <code>i7+8</code>,
because we did not shift register windows. If we had shifted register windows,
as we’ll see shortly when returning from <code>sub1</code>, we would use <code>ret</code> because the
return address placed in the output register (<code>o7</code>) of the previous procedure
would now reside in the input register (<code>i7</code>) of the current procedure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that we offset the return address by <code>8</code> in order to account for the
delay slot instruction that follows the <code>call</code> location but was executed prior
to transfer of control.</p>

<p>Register windows are curiously absent from most ISAs that are widely used today
(i.e. x86, Arm, etc.). I discovered a number sources in which critiques of
register windows are provided. A few examples are referenced below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is just too hard to deal with the interrupts, and the spilling, and
predicting performance.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-lyon-b1642265/">Tom Lyon</a> on the
<a href="https://youtu.be/79NNXn5Kr90?t=531">aforementioned Oxide and Friends episode</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The register windows overlap partially, thus the out registers become renamed
by SAVE to become the in registers of the called procedure. Thus, the memory
traffic is reduced when going up and down the procedure call. Since this is a
frequent operation, performance is improved. (That was the idea, anyway. The
drawback is that upon interactions with the system the registers need to be
flushed to the stack, necessitating a long sequence of writes to memory of
data that is often mostly garbage. Register windows was a bad idea that was
caused by simulation studies that considered only programs in isolation, as
opposed to multitasking workloads, and by considering compilers with poor
optimization. It also caused considerable problems in implementing high-end
Sparc processors such as the SuperSparc, although more recent implementations
have dealt effectively with the obstacles. Register windows is now part of the
compatibility legacy and not easily removed from the architecture.)”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>- <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gbournou/">Garo Bournoutian</a>, University of
California, San Diego. <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gbournou/CSE131/sparcstack.html">Understanding stacks and registers in the Sparc
architecture(s)</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Although this idea seems great at first, there are a few disadvantages to
windowing. First is that in large programs, where there is much recursion, the
limited amount of physical registers fill up and you are back to the
traditional push/pop stack usage, along with additional overhead of managing
the windows and handling window overflow exceptions. Since it is hard to
predict when the registers will overflow, performance analysis can be
difficult. Also, hardware engineering becomes more difficult to implement the
large amount of physical registers and multiplexers.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>- Saunders Roesser, James Madison University. <a href="https://users.cs.jmu.edu/abzugcx/Public/Computer-Architecture/Term-Projects/">Interesting Points of the SPARC
Processor</a>.</em></p>
<p>To summarize some of the consistent themes from these sources, there seems to be
three primary issues with the design of register windows.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Implementing register windows increases the complexity of the processor
design.</strong> This attribute on its own is not reason to throw out the
functionality, and could also be said for implementing any additional logic
in a processor. However, it serves to illustrate that all processor
functionality comes at a cost and must be justified by tangible performance
improvements. For example, in the previously mentioned description of
alternative register windowing schemes in the SPARC architecture manual, one
pattern mentioned was not using register windows at all. If design complexity
was free then perhaps an argument could be made that supporting register
windows makes sense because a user can always opt not to utilize them. The
issue with that outlook is that the complexity is not free, and mixed
programming models can lead to incompatibility and poor user experience.</li>
<li><strong>There is not enough attention paid to the cost of register windows when
interacting with the operating system.</strong> When just moving between procedures
in a single program, as our minimal example demonstrated, a reasonable case
can be made for the improvements offered by the increased number of registers
offered by windowing. However, when transferring control from a program to
the system, we now have many more registers that must be written to memory so
that they can later be restored. The more often we switch between programs,
the more costly this becomes.</li>
<li><strong>Reasoning about the performance of a program becomes more difficult.</strong>
Because the number of registers is still limited, a program may overflow or
underflow the current register window, resulting in a trap to the operating
system. This not only requires the system to implement functionality to
properly handle these cases, but also imposes an unpredictable performance
penalty on the program.</li>
</ol>
<p>Time has proven that register windows, while an interesting idea, do not provide
the right set of performance and complexity tradeoffs. However, there is a key
takeaway that can be gleaned from both the justification and critique of the
functionality: <strong>when designing processors, it is vital to consider the holistic
system</strong>. Programs do not exist in a vacuum, and changing one aspect of the
computation model frequently results in unintended consequences in other areas.
That being said, I am hopeful that the growing accessibility of processor design
results in even more experimentation that we can learn from and improve upon. I
am deeply grateful that we have the opportunity to look back on the tremendous
work from folks at Berkeley, Sun, and elsewhere, and let it inform how we chart
a path forward.</p>
