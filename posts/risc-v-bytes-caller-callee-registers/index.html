<p>This is part of a new series I am starting on the blog where we’ll explore
<a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a> by breaking down real programs and explaining how
they work. You can view all posts in this series on the <a href="https://danielmangum.com/categories/risc-v-bytes">RISC-V Bytes
page</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When looking at the generated assembly for a function, you may have noticed that
the first few instructions involve moving values from registers to the stack,
then loading those values back into the same registers before returning. In this
post we&rsquo;ll explore why this is happening, why certain registers are used, and
how behavior guarantees make life easier for compiler authors and enable
software portability.</p>
<h2 id="defining-terms">Defining Terms</h2>
<p>Before we dive into what is happening there, let&rsquo;s define some terms and take a
look at the 32 general purpose registers supported in the RISC-V instruction
set.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Caller</strong>: a procedure that calls one or more more subsequent procedure(s).</li>
<li><strong>Callee</strong>: a procedure that is called by another.</li>
<li><strong>Application Binary Interface (ABI)</strong>: a standard for register usage and
memory layout that allows for programs that are not compiled together to
interact effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Calling Conventions</strong>: a subset of an ABI specifically focused on how data
is passed from one procedure to another.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, a procedure may be both a <em>caller</em> and a <em>callee</em>.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s take a look at the RISC-V registers:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>ABI Mnemonic</th>
<th>Calling Convention</th>
<th>Preserved across calls?</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>x0</td>
<td>zero</td>
<td>Zero</td>
<td>n/a</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>x1</td>
<td>ra</td>
<td>Return address</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>x2</td>
<td>sp</td>
<td>Stack pointer</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>x3</td>
<td>gp</td>
<td>Global pointer</td>
<td>n/a</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>x4</td>
<td>tp</td>
<td>Thread pointer</td>
<td>n/a</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>x5-x7</td>
<td>t0-t2</td>
<td>Temporary registers</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>x8-x9</td>
<td>s0-s1</td>
<td>Saved registers</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>x10-x17</td>
<td>a0-a7</td>
<td>Argument registers</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>x18-x27</td>
<td>s2-s11</td>
<td>Saved registers</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>x28-x31</td>
<td>t3-t6</td>
<td>Temporary registers</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice the second column refers to the <em>Application Binary Interface
(ABI)</em> and the third refers to the <em>Calling Convention</em>, both of which we
defined earlier. This likely makes intuitive sense: if we all agree to use
certain registers for specific purposes, we can expect data to be there without
having to explicitly say that it is.</p>
<p>The fourth column may be a bit more opaque. While this table uses <em>Preserved
across calls?</em> as a designation, you will frequently see all of the registers
with <em>Yes</em> in the column referred to as <strong>callee-saved</strong> and those with <em>No</em> as
<strong>caller-saved</strong>. This once again is related to how procedures communicate. It
is great to agree on the purpose of our registers, but we also need to define
what responsibilites a procedure has when interacting with them. In order for a
register to be preserved across calls, the callee must make sure its value is
the same when it returns to the caller as it was when the callee was, well,
called!</p>
<h2 id="an-example">An Example</h2>
<p>The simplest example is the <code>main</code> function. You may be tempted to think that
<code>main</code> would be an example of a procedure that is only a caller. In reality, it
is called after some initial setup, which can very greatly depending on the
language and the compiler. Almost every procedure is a callee, and only <em>leaf
procedures</em> are not callers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be using our program from <a href="https://danielmangum.com/posts/risc-v-bytes-qemu-gdb/">last
post</a> to show how
registers are preserved. In this case, <code>main</code> is being called by <code>_start</code> and it
calls <code>printf</code>.</p>

</code></pre></div><blockquote>
<p>You may be thinking to yourself: why do we need so many instructions that just
store a register into memory, then immediately load it back? Good question! We
don&rsquo;t! For simplicity here, we are compiling using <code>gcc</code> without any
optimization. This essentially means that each source line is assembled in a
vacuum without much consideration of the surrounding context. While this is
inefficient and leads to a much larger program size, it can be useful for
learning. Take a look at this program <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/hExE7v6h4">on Compiler
Explorer</a> and hover over the output to see
which instructions map to each source line. We&rsquo;ll explore how different
optimization levels change code generation in a future post.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start from the top. The first thing you&rsquo;ll notice is that we are
decreasing the value in <code>sp</code>, our stack pointer register. Our first four
instructions here are commonly referred to as the <em>function prologue</em>. For
today&rsquo;s post we are going to be primarily focusing on it and the <em>function
epilogue</em> because these sections are where we perform the bookkeeping operations
that are necessary to conform to calling conventions.</p>
<p>When we move the stack pointer, we are essentially incrementing or decrementing
the size of our stack. In RISC-V, the stack grows downwards, so <code>addi sp, sp, -32</code> is increasing the size of our downward growing stack by changing the stack
pointer to contain an address 32 bytes lower.</p>
<h2 id="a-caller-saved-register">A Caller-Saved Register</h2>
<p>Next we want to store the contents of the saved registers onto the stack. Let&rsquo;s
pause for a moment and think about why we need to do this. If the registers are
designated as &ldquo;saved&rdquo;, can we not just leave them untouched throughout the body
of our procedure, keeping them intact when we return to the procedure that
called us?</p>
<p>This is true if we are not going to re-use those registers at any point in our
procedure we need to make sure we preserve their contents. For instance, take a
look at <code>&lt;+42&gt;</code> where we call <code>printf</code>. Here we are specifying that we want to
jump to the location of the <code>printf</code> procedure and set the contents of register
<code>ra</code> to the address of the program counter plus four (<code>ra &lt;- PC + 4</code>). This will
inform <code>printf</code> to return to the address of the next instruction in our <code>main</code>
body (<code>&lt;+50&gt;</code>). However, when <code>printf</code> does return, we need to know how to
return to the procedure that called us (<code>_start</code>).</p>
<p>If we hadn&rsquo;t saved the contents of <code>ra</code> in the prologue (<code>&lt;+2&gt;</code>), we would have
lost that address, but because we stored it on the stack, we can load it back
into <code>ra</code> in the epilogue (<code>&lt;+54&gt;</code>) and return to <code>_start</code>. Meanwhile, in the
rest of the procedure body, we are free to use the register as needed. If we
look at our table of general purpose registers above, we&rsquo;ll notice that <code>ra</code> is
designated as <em>caller-saved</em> (i.e. it is <em>not</em> preserved across calls). This
aligns with the behavior we see as <code>main</code>, as the caller, saves <code>ra</code> before
calling <code>printf</code> and updating <code>ra</code> with the address of the next instruction.</p>
<h2 id="a-callee-saved-register">A Callee-Saved Register</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also notice that we are storing <code>s0</code> on the stack in the prologue
(<code>&lt;+4&gt;</code>). Besides being designated as a <em>callee-saved</em> register, <code>s0</code> is <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/388954fc835e782cbedffcdb502cf816bd978771/riscv-elf.md#integer-register-convention-">used
as the <em>frame pointer</em> if one
exists</a>.
The stack frame is the area of the stack reserved for the current procedure and
it stretches from the <em>frame pointer</em> to the <em>stack pointer</em>. Procedures may use
the frame pointer with an offset to store values on the stack, such as a
variable that is only in-scope for that procedure (e.g. <code>&lt;+10&gt;</code>). In this way,
the frame pointer is a boundary, marking the beginning of the region of the
stack available for the procedure.</p>
<p>It is imperative that the frame pointer, or any other <em>callee-saved</em> register
that is modified in the procedure, is restored prior to returning to the caller.
Since <code>_start</code> is expecting its frame pointer to be unmodified after calling
<code>main</code>, we must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Store it in the stack frame for <code>main</code> (<code>&lt;+4&gt;</code>).</li>
<li>Set the new frame pointer for <code>main</code> (<code>&lt;+6&gt;</code>). You&rsquo;ll notice the frame
pointer now contains the address the stack pointer contained when our
procedure began.</li>
<li>Restore it before returning (<code>&lt;+56&gt;</code>).</li>
</ol>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that we will also restore the stack pointer (<code>&lt;+58&gt;</code>), as it is a
<em>callee-saved</em> register as well. However, unlike <code>ra</code>, we don&rsquo;t have to worry
about storing the contents of <code>s0</code> or <code>sp</code> on the stack prior to calling
<code>printf</code> because it will adhere to the same conventions as a callee that <code>main</code>
does for <code>_start</code>, ensuring that all of our <em>callee-saved</em> registers are
unmodified when it returns.</p>
<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding Thoughts</h2>
<p>While we have only scratched the surface of the benefits of ABI-compatibility in
this post, we can already begin to see its value. In future posts, we&rsquo;ll take a
look at how a standardized ABI is even more important when depending on shared
libraries, as well as examine some more complex examples of passing data between
procedures. As always, these post are meant to serve as a useful resource for
folks who are interested in learning more about RISC-V and low-level software in
general. If I can do a better job of reaching that goal, or you have any
