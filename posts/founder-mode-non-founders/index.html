        <p>Paul Graham’s <a href="https://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html">Founder Mode</a> essay,
based on a recent talk from AirBnB founder Brian Chesky, has been getting quite
a lot of attention over the past few days. It has prompted many a quote tweet,
and founders, such as <a href="https://oxide.computer/blog/reflections-on-founder-mode">Bryan Cantrill of Oxide
Computer</a>, have started
contributing their own thoughts to what founder mode means to them.</p>
<p>Having held positions of influence at a few companies, but never having been a
founder myself, my initial read raised a few thoughts about my own experience of
trying to “scale myself” in a growing organization. However, given that many who
do have experience as founders have already weighed in on that front, I think
the topic more pertinent to my experience is what it looks like to work with a
CEO in founder mode.</p>
<p>On the surface, founder mode as described by Graham could be viewed as a
negative for other influential members of the organization. It is positioned in
contrast to a manager mode in which direct reports are given more autonomy in
both roadmap and execution. In my experience, working with an effective founder
mode CEO has actually been more enjoyable than one in manager mode. I have found
that that the leader’s candor typically permeates throughout the organization,
and others feel empowered to occupy the full scope of their role because they
see the CEO doing the same.</p>
<p>That being said, I believe the leaders in founder mode require <em>more</em> help from
those around them, not less. In Graham’s words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where the borders of autonomy end up, and how sharp they are, will probably
vary from company to company. They&rsquo;ll even vary from time to time within the
same company, as managers earn trust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A founder mode leader must constantly be experimenting with and evaluating these
borders, which can be draining. There are a few ways in which others in the
organization can help them be successful.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be opinionated:</strong> The worst case scenario for an organization with a leader
in founder mode is for everyone else to blindly comply. I think so many
organizations are drawn towards manager mode because it appears to have a
higher floor than founder mode. When decision making is spread across many
different actors, the probability that one can bring down the entire ship may
be diminished. In founder mode, decision making power is more centralized,
meaning that poor decision-making can quickly derail the entire organization.
It is vital that those closest to the founder constantly express their view
points, undeterred by any historical pattern of their ideas being enacted.</li>
<li><strong>Respect the organizational hierarchy:</strong> In addition to challenging the
founder, individuals must also be ready to accept decisions and move forward
without reservation or resentment. Hierarchy is neither inherently bad or
inherently good. Hierarchy makes decision making power explicit, which can
lead to bad outcomes when that power is abused. However, when that power is
wielded with the proper reverence and respect, hierarchy can create an
efficient and coherent system. While hierarchy may look different in every
organization, it is unlikely that an organization with a founder mode leader
will be successful if others are not willing to occupy their role in the
hierarchy. Sometimes that role may be the decision maker.</li>
<li><strong>Force explicit decision making:</strong> Founders go wrong when there is an
imbalance of privilege and responsibility. A founder mode leader is granted
tremendous privilege, but they must accept commensurate responsibility.
Things can quickly go awry if they are unwilling to accept responsibility,
but also are unwilling to cede decision making power to those around them.
This frequently manifests as delaying decisions, rather than deferring them
to someone else. This can happen when a founder has lost confidence, or has
too much on their plate. Individuals close to them are most helpful when they
remain persistent until a decision is made, whether by the founder themselves
or someone they delegate to.</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps the primary takeaway is that founder mode is less about being a founder,
and more about taking ownership. By that definition, an organization that is
successful with a leader in founder mode is one in which those around them are
also in founder mode (albeit with different context and constraints). They take
ownership, and in doing so, make it more apparent where the leader should draw
the “borders of autonomy”. As a side benefit, they are becoming more equipped to
one day be founders themselves.</p>
