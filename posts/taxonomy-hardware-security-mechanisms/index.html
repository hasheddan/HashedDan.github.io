        <p>Isolating sensitive data and operations is a fundamental issue in computing.
Ideally, we want to minimize the possibility of a software defect compromising
the security of a device. However, in order for the software we write to be
useful, it typically needs to interact with that sensitive data in some form or
fashion. So how do we interact with sensitive data without being able to access
it?</p>
<p>The answer is that we bring only the operations that <em>must</em> access the sensitive
data closer to the data, then force all other software to invoke those
operations via some sort of interface. These restrictions are implemented in
hardware, either in the same processor that the insecure software runs on, or on
a physically separate component. When the hardware protections are implemented
in the same processor, the secure environment it typically referred to as a
<strong>Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)</strong> or <strong>secure enclave</strong>. When a separate
component, it may be referred to as a <strong>Hardware Security Module (HSM)</strong>,
<strong>smart card</strong>, <strong>Secure Element (SE)</strong>, or, if you&rsquo;re Apple, a <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2024/06/15/a-brief-history-of-mac-enclaves-and-exclaves/"><strong>Secure
Exclave</strong></a>.
The definitions vary depending on who you ask, but most folks will generally
refer to large data center scale PCI devices, such as the <a href="https://www.marvell.com/products/security-solutions/liquidsecurity2.html">Marvell
LiquidSecurity
devices</a>
used by <a href="https://cloud.google.com/docs/security/cloud-hsm-architecture">Google&rsquo;s Cloud HSM
service</a>, as
HSMs. Smaller components, which may be present on the same board as a laptop,
phone, or embedded device, are typically referred to as secure elements. These
small dedicated components are also sometimes referred to as smart cards, though
the prevalence of smart card chips on payment and identification cards has led
to more common association with these passive use-cases (e.g. inserted into a
reader or brought into proximity with an interrogating device). It all gets
quite convoluted, but as this excellent <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/209074/what-are-the-differences-between-hsm-and-se">comment from a Stack Overflow
user</a>
succinctly states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In a nutshell, if it hurts when you drop it on your foot, it&rsquo;s an HSM. If you
carry it in your wallet, it&rsquo;s a smartcard. If it&rsquo;s a non-removable smartcard,
it&rsquo;s a secure element.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we remove smart cards from the conversation, my own take on the organization
of hardware security mechanisms, which I am certain will be viewed as overly
simplistic by many, is as follows.</p>



<div class="center-img">

    alt="The Taxonomy of Hardware Security Mechanisms"
  />
</div>
<p>Two other terms that you&rsquo;ll hear mentioned in this domain are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module"><strong>Trusted
Platform Module (TPM)</strong></a>
and <a href="https://www.psacertified.org/blog/what-is-a-root-of-trust/"><strong>Root of Trust
(RoT)</strong></a>. TPM, while
sometimes used to refer to a hardware component, is actually a
<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/66510.html">specification</a>, which can be
implemented by hardware, software, or some combination of the two. RoT is an
even less precise term, with no universal specification, but rather a general
definition of the combination of hardware and software that allows for all other
components to operate securely. A common example is secure boot, when involves
verifying that firmware is signed by a specific private key prior to allowing it
to execute.</p>
<p>With all of these security options available, it can be difficult to determine
what to use when architecting a secure system. For example, if using an Arm
processor that supports
<a href="https://www.arm.com/technologies/trustzone-for-cortex-m">TrustZone</a>, which
enables separating secure (TEE) and non-secure execution on the same processor,
you may choose to leverage it rather than introducing a new component that
drives up cost and complexity. However, TEE solutions alone may fail to guard
against physical tampering, as well as side-channel attacks. Arm <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ka005578/1-0">notes in their
security documentation</a>
some of the risks involved with using only TrustZone for isolation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;TrustZone technology for Armv8-M processors or the Security Extension in the
Armv8-M architecture is designed to provide hardware enforced isolation
between software environments. This arrangement protects against most software
attacks and covers the security needs for many applications. Side channels are
a class of attacks that aim to infer information about the secret program
state based on observations arising from the implementation details of a
program, rather than on flaws in the protocol or algorithm itself&hellip; The
Security Extensions for the Armv8-M architecture do not claim to protect
against side channel attacks due to control flow or memory access patterns.
Indeed, such attacks are not specific to the Armv8-M architecture; they may
apply to any code with secret-dependent control flow or memory access
patterns.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If necessary to guard against physical tampering, some processors, such as the
<a href="https://developer.arm.com/Processors/Cortex-M35P">Arm Cortex-M35P</a>, offer
physical tamper resistance. However, issues like side channel attacks may still
be possible when there is not physical isolation between the memory of the
secure and non-secure execution environments. For further isolation, and
potentially for acceleration of cryptographic operations, a secure element, such
as one of the processors in the <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/security/security-ics/cryptoauthentication-family">Microchip CryptoAuthentication
family</a>,
may be necessary. This isn&rsquo;t to say that secure elements are impervious to
physical access attacks. In fact, multiple processors in the
CryptoAuthentication family have been found to be <a href="https://youtu.be/Kj1nVJypXPM?si=ZobZ0RgWHHh1Df2j">exploitable via Laser Fault
Injection (LFI)</a>. It is also
entirely possible that the firmware on the secure element itself could have a
defect.</p>
<p>Microchip&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/ATECC608C">ATECC608</a> has
become particularly popular in embedded devices due to its low power and wide
variety of features. It supports secure storage, Elliptic Curve Diffie-Helman
(ECDH), Elliptic Curve Digitial Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES), and more. It is also supported by Microchip&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/security/trust-platform">Trust
Platform</a>, and
a source available SDK,
<a href="https://github.com/MicrochipTech/cryptoauthlib">CryptoAuthLib</a>, is provided to
integrate the ATECC608 with many microcontrollers and microprocessors. Though
not previously mentioned, another benefit of using a secure element is the
ability to leverage any secure provisioning support offered by the silicon
vendor. Microchip&rsquo;s Trust Platform provides a number of different solutions,
including <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/security/trust-platform/trust-and-go">vendor-managed certificate
provisioning</a>
and <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/security/trust-platform/trustflex">customer-managed certificate
provisioning</a>.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that I am fascinated by hardware security mechanisms is
because, despite the critical role they play in a system, much of the
information about how to use them and how they work is <a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/2022/towards-a-more-open-secure-element-chip/">kept behind NDAs and
proprietary
firmware</a>.
This is even more true when it comes to combining multiple hardware security
mechanisms together, which is typically required for a sufficient security
strategy. Now that we have a common understanding of the types of mechanisms
available to us, we can explore them each in greater depth.</p>
