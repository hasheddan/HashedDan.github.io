      <description>In our most recent post in the Kubernetes API Server Adventures series we took a look at the storage interface and explored the only in-tree implementation: etcd3. However, a careful read of the footnotes in that post revealed I wasn&amp;rsquo;t being completely honest about etcd3 being the only implementation.
This could be disputed as Cacher is technically an implementation as well. However, it requires an underlying implementation in order to perform its operations.</description>

      <description>Like most API servers, a, if not the, primary function of the Kubernetes API Server is to ingest data, store it, then return it when requested. Today we are going to be focusing on how the API Server stores data.

      <description>Kubernetes is comprised of a variety of components, yet most end-user interaction with the system flows through the API Server. It is the entrypoint to many of the features that the project has built up over its lifetime, and can be extended to support arbitrary additional functionality. Because of this, the API Server has proved to be a bottleneck in some cases that it was not originally designed to accommodate, or at least accommodate well.</description>
