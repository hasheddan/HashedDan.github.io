      <description>This is part of a series on the blog where we explore RISC-V by breaking down real programs and explaining how they work. You can view all posts in this series on the RISC-V Bytes page.
 Today we are going to take a brief detour from our previous posts in this series and look at Rust Cross-Compilation for RISC-V. This will be a shorter post focused on providing useful information about how rustc works, as well as offering exact steps and configuration to target RISC-V when compiling your Rust programs.</description>

 It has been a bit since our last post, but today we are going to begin our journey into some of the more interesting areas of RISC-V systems. In the first post in the series, we installed our RISC-V toolchain, which included QEMU.</description>

 So far in this series, we have been looking at the assembly generated when compiling relatively simple programs. At this point, we have seen instructions that perform a wide variety of operations. Let&amp;rsquo;s take another look at our minimal example from the Passing on the Stack post:</description>

 I once took a class on compilers where my professor told us that a CPU is like a human brain: it can store important data and access it quickly, but there is a limit to the amount of data that can be stored.</description>

      <description>This is part of a new series I am starting on the blog where weâ€™ll explore RISC-V by breaking down real programs and explaining how they work. You can view all posts in this series on the RISC-V Bytes page.
 When looking at the generated assembly for a function, you may have noticed that the first few instructions involve moving values from registers to the stack, then loading those values back into the same registers before returning.</description>

 To start of the series, we are just going to get setup to do some exploration. I am going to assume you will not primarily be using a RISC-V machine1, so we need to configure our local development environment for cross-platform compiling, emulation, and debugging.</description>
