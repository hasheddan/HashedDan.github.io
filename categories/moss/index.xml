      <description>I turn 27 years old today, which feels both very old and very young. 30 is often seen as a milestone, perhaps because you have spent nearly a decade operating as an “adult”, but likely are still considered in the earlier part of your career. I am a firm believer that doing most things of significance takes at least 3 years, which makes 27 a good time to decide to commit to “doing something before you are 30”.</description>
